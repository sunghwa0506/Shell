# Shell
In this project, create my own shell program, Mav shell (msh), similar to
bourne shell (bash), c-shell (csh), or korn shell (ksh). It will accept commands, fork a child
process and execute those commands. The shell, like csh or bash, will run and accept
commands until the user exits the shell. 

PDF file for project description is available for easy readability.
